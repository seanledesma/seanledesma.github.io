    "content": "I’ve been messing around with Raylib a bit more recently, trying to get circles to move around the screen and collide with each other. This seemed pretty trivial at first, but the difficulty of getting accurate collisions caught me by surprise.I started by creating an array of ball structs, with each struct only containing three properties; position, speed and radius.typedef struct Ball{    Vector2 position;    Vector2 speed;    float radius;} Ball;Inside the game loop, I would loop through the array of balls to update their position with their speed. So if the ball was going to the right of the screen, I’d add the ball’s speed to the position, like so:// continue ball in direction at set speedballs[i].position.x += balls[i].speed.x;balls[i].position.y += balls[i].speed.y;and if the ball hit a wall, I’d multiply the balls speed by negative one, so it would start subtracting from the balls position every loop instead of adding:// if balls hit wall, deflect right angle (?)if (balls[i].position.x &gt;= (screenWidth - balls[i].radius) || balls[i].position.x &lt;= balls[i].radius)    balls[i].speed.x *= -1.0f;    if (balls[i].position.y &gt;= (screenHeight - balls[i].radius) || balls[i].position.y &lt;= balls[i].radius)    balls[i].speed.y *= -1.0f;This works decently well, although it doesn’t look natural at all. What ends up happening is the balls hit the wall, both the x and y speed gets multiplied by negative one, so it effectively makes the ball bounce off at a perfect 90 degree angle every time.I then wanted to make the balls bounce off of each other, which seemed simple enough. You can detect collisions in Raylib between two circles like so:CheckCollisionCircles(balls[i].position, balls[i].radius, balls[j].position, balls[j].radius)but this had some unexpected results. Upon collision, the balls would immediately flip directions and head back the way they came, which is obviously very unnatural. How on earth do I get the balls to bounce off each other in a natural-looking way?"

    "content": "I’m currently working my way through the textbook C programming - A Modern Approach and I’ve found it really well written and digestible. It’s really made me excited to program. Every page is information-dense, and K.N. King provides a Q.A. section, exercises, and projects at the end of every chapter, which I have found immensely useful. However, I have found myself hungry for more than just the provided project challenges, and that’s when I discovered Raylib. I’ve had the chance to work with Raylib for a few small projects now, and I find it really intuitive and easy to use, which is hardly heard of in the C world. I started by messing around with some of the example projects, then started making small demos myself. I was even able to make a functional albeit basic clone of the flappy bird game, which you can see on my Github here.I know it’s possible to compile Raylib projects into webassembly, which is something I’m very excited to check out. I’ve got some future plans for more Raylib projects, using what I learn as I work my way through the textbook I mentioned earlier. I’ll post later on my findings."
